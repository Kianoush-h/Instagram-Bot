# Instagram Bot
 Automate your Instagram activity with two approaches:
	1) InstaBot >> a customisable bot that likes, follows and comments
	2) WEB scraping 
	




## WEB scraping

To be clear, I’m not using this bot intensively, as Instagram will stop responding if you run it too fast. It needs to have some sleep commands in between the actions, because after some comments and follows in a short period of time, Instagram stops responding and the bot crashes.
